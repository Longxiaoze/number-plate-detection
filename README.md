# License Plate Detection and Measure the Inter Vehicle Distance with ML
This is the C++ application to detect license plate and measure the inter vehicle distance.

The core technologies is the following:
1. Car detection with Cascade Classifier trained by AdaBoost.
2. License Plate detection with Vertical Edge Histogram.
3. Distance Calcuration from the size of License Plate.

This repository includes the sources for evaluation of this system.
